# 📚 Data Structure and Algorithm Implementations in C++

Welcome to the **Data_Structure_and_Algorithm_Cpp** repository! This repository contains various data structures and algorithms implemented using C++. It serves as a reference and practice ground for commonly used data structures.

## 🚀 Implemented Data Structures and Algorithms

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- **Graph Algorithms**: Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP)
- **Graphs**: Adjacency List and Matrix implementations
- **Heap**: Min-Heap and Max-Heap
- **Hash Tables**: Hash functions, collision handling, and various implementations
- **Linked Lists**: Single and Doubly Linked Lists

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C++**: All data structures and algorithms are implemented using C++.
